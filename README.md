[shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) is an Apple AirPlay receiver. It can receive audio directly from iOS devices, iTunes, etc. Multiple instances of shairport-sync will stay in sync with each other and other AirPlay devices when used with a compatible multi-room player, such as iTunes or [forked-daapd](https://github.com/jasonmc/forked-daapd).

This is a fork of the project by [Kevin Eye](https://github.com/kevineye/docker-shairport-sync) which seemed abandonded.
